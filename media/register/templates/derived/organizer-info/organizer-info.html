<p>So you've read the blurb on the <a href="{% url register.views.home %}">
Home</a> page and maybe even pre-registered for a brevet or
two. But you're also the organizer of a future BC Randonneurs brevet,
and now you're thinking "This is cool!  Can I get my brevet added to
the <a href="{% url register.views.about_pony %}">RandoPony</a>?". You
betcha!</p>

<p>Just send an email to <kbd>{{admin_email}}</kbd> with the following
information:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Region, distance and date of your brevet; e.g. VI200
  21-Aug-2010</li>
  <li>Route name</li>
  <li>Start location and time</li>
  <li>Email address that you want to receive rider pre-registration
  notices at</li>
</ul>

<p>We'll add the brevet and pre-registration from pages for your event
to the pony and notify the <a
 href="http://randonneurs.bc.ca">randonneurs.bc.ca</a> webmaster so
that they can make links from the club pages to your brevet page
here. As riders pre-register for your event their names will appear in
the list on the page for your brevet, and you'll receive email
messages from the pony letting you know their name, email address, and
club membership status. Easy, eh!?</p>

<p>If you're visiting from another cycling club and are interested in
getting a pony of your own, please read the
<a href="{% url register.views.about_pony %}">What's up with the
pony?</a> page for information on how you can get and deploy this
open-source software.</p>
